HOWTO Install course framework.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Week3 framework does not need any installing at all. From week4 you need some 
installation things done. Those are explained below. The configuration does 
not change, so form week4 to following weeks the configuration is the same.

NOTICE:
Week 5 and after that frameworks do not have configuration.php file in them. 
You copy that from the week 4 framework, after creating and filling 
the data to it. Database does not change so you can use the same database.


There are three things to do to fully install framework.

1) You need configuration.php file. week 4 framework opened with browser 
tell this to you at the default frontpage:

"Can not find configuration file /var/www/fwweek4/configuration.php
Rename from the root folder the file configuration.mysql.php OR 
configuration.postgre.php as configuration.php"

2) You need to create database and put its configuration to the 
configuration.php

3) You need two tables created to the database.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Creating configuration.php file

There are to files in the root folder of the week4_framework.zip. 
One is for the mysql database, the other for the postgre database.

Choose the one you need and copy or rename it to 
root folder as configuration.php.

Now when you open http://localhost or uta-http address to framework, you see 
message in red that asks you to read help to install database.


2) YOU NEED TO CREATE DATABASE.

With uta postgre, you alredy have one, read 
database_instructions.txt how to create user there.

With XAMPP you have in your computer PhpMyAdmin installed at 
localhost/phpmyadmin. Use that to create database.
Xampp mysql has user root with empty password. No need to change that.

AFTER YOU HAVE CREATED DATABASE or created postgre user with password:

Put database configuration values to configuration.php

There is two ways to do this. Open it with text editor and fill the section
'database' => 'FILL HERE',
'dbuser' => 'FILL HERE',
'dbpass' => 'FILL HERE',

The other way is to open link index.php?app=configuration and fill the form and
save.

With XAMPP dbuser is root, dbpass is empty string and database is the name you 
used when creating one. With postgre you need correct host, user and password.

See index.php?app=configuration&cntr=install for more instructions if needed.

3)

Database tables someuser and somesession

After you have created database and configuration.php has all the 
database settings, the link

index.php?app=configuration&cntr=install

opens a view, where you have to Action links in the bottom of the page. Click
 these links and tables are installed by the framework for you.

If you want to install those tables manually, the CREATE sql commands are found 
at the page:

index.php?app=helpindex.php?app=help

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example of my configuration.php file for the mysql in XAMPP is following:

<?php
    defined('SOME_PATH') or die('Unauthorized access');
    $configuration = array (
  'common' => 
  array (
    'livesite' => '',
    'language' => 'fi_FI',
    'secret' => 'safsf543fyg43hydrth',
    'template' => 'default',
  ),
  'session' => 
  array (
    'lifetime' => '45',
    'session_handler' => 'file',
    'session_table' => 'somesession',
  ),
  'database' => 
  array (
    'databasedriver' => 'pdomysql',
    'databasehost' => '127.0.0.1',
    'database' => 'fwweek4',
    'dbuser' => 'root',
    'dbpass' => '',
  ),
  'debug' => 
  array (
    'debug' => '0',
    'debugfile' => 'debug.log',
  ),
);

Database created for the example is named fwweek4.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Remember to copy configuration.php to any other installation you may create
with frameworks for weeks 5 and later. That is all you need to do after these 
3 steps.

SQL for the mysql database

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `somesession` (
  `sesskey` char(32) NOT NULL,
  `expiry` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `value` text
) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 COLLATE=utf8_swedish_ci


CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `someuser` (
  `id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `username` varchar(32) DEFAULT NULL,
  `password` char(32) DEFAULT NULL,
  `userrole` char(32) DEFAULT NULL,
  `email` text,
  `homepage` text,
  UNIQUE KEY `id` (`id`)
) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 COLLATE=utf8_swedish_ci AUTO_INCREMENT=1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SQL for the postgre database

CREATE TABLE somesession (
    sesskey character(32) NOT NULL,
    expiry integer NOT NULL,
    value text
)

CREATE TABLE someuser (
   id SERIAL,
   username character varying(32),
   "password" character(32),
 userrole character(32),
   email text,
   homepage text
	)
